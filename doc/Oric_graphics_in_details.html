Which is why it's called "8 bit" computer in first place.<br><br>The logical consequence is that these computers tend to use <b>8x8</b> pixels as the natural font size, and tend to pack pixels by groups of 8.<br><br>The Oric on the other hand only has <b>6x8</b> characters, and a weird 240x224 graphical resolution: The reason is that each byte of the video memory contains <b>reserved codes</b> that limit the number of displayable values.<br><br>Most machines have some I/O registers that can be used to change colors, switch video modes or read the position of the video beam. They also often have separate video memory buffers for bitmap data, color data, sprite data, etc...<br><br>On the Oric there is no such thing: There is only one area of video memory, and all the <b>commands</b> sent to the graphic chip are done by writing directly <i>commands inside the video memory</i> by using some reserved control codes different from actual bitmap data.<br><br>The main consequence is of course that this interferes with what is on the screen: You cannot have a byte on the screen that both represent something to display and be also a control code. <b>It's either-or</b>.<br><br>A corollary is also the reduction of available bits to represent visual data since some of the bit are used to identify Attributes.<br><br>As a general rule, any value in the 0 to 31 range has to be considered as an Attribute<a name="noteref1"></a><sup><a href="https://osdk.org/index.php?page=articles&amp;ref=ART9#note1">1</a></sup>, and any value above 127 is using the Inverse Video mode.<br><br>I will detail these later.<br><br><a name="title6"></a><a href="https://osdk.org/index.php?page=articles&amp;ref=ART9#toc"><h2>Monochrome graphics</h2></a>If the byte value happens to not be an attribute, then it means it contains a displayable value - either a character ASCII code if you are in TEXT mode, or some bitmap representation if you are in HIRES - ultimately represented on screen as 6 pixels:<br><ul><li>each 0 bit will be drawn using the PAPER (background) color<br></li><li>each 1 bit will be drawn using the INK (foreground) color<br></li></ul>When the oric starts to display one of the 200 scanlines, the value of PAPER is always reset to BLACK, and the value of INK is always reset to WHITE.<br><br>So without doing anything special you can draw monochrome pictures in 240x200 resolution by using the default BLACK and WHITE colors.<br><br><center><div class="picture "><a

called "Serial", is that they are valid only on the scanline they are present (the frequency change is the exception), and only impact what is on their right.<br><br>Using these values, you should be able to achieve any possible trick known by Oric developer: Mixing character sets, changing the size of characters, having parts of the screen blink, change colors and display rasters, and mix and match different screen modes.<br><br>It's by using the Color Change attributes that you can get colors on your screen.<br><br><a name="title8"></a><a href="https://osdk.org/index.php?page=articles&amp;ref=ART9#toc"><h2>Frequency change</h2></a>As you probably noticed on the previous table, the ULA can output pictures at <b>50hz</b> or <b>60hz</b>.<br><br>If no frequency change attribute is used, the system will keep using whatever frequency was used to display the last image.<br><br>Some of you have been playing on the Commodore 64 and Atari ST, writing values to the video registers while the image was being generated, changing frequency on the fly, resulting in fancy new video modes, distorted displays, border removal, or fancy <b>hardware scrolling</b>.<br><br><b>Unfortunately</b>,  when it encounters one of the video mode control code the ULA only seem to store the value internally and use whatever was there on the next frame.<br><br>Another difficulty <i>- if one was trying to experiment with these fancy control codes -</i> is that there is <b>no vertical synchronization</b> register available on the machine: You don't know where the electron beam is. <a name="noteref2"></a><sup><a href="https://osdk.org/index.php?page=articles&amp;ref=ART9#note2">2</a></sup><br><a name="title9"></a><a href="https://osdk.org/index.php?page=articles&amp;ref=ART9#toc"><h2>Paper and Ink color</h2></a>Technically, a <b>colored</b> Oric picture is just a <b>monochrome</b> picture which happens to have the PAPER and INK values changed here and there.<br><br>Think of it like if you made a 2 colors picture on an Atari ST or Amiga, and then you used some interruption/Copper to change the color registers values at specific point in time: It would appear as a multi-color picture but bitmap wise it would still be stored as a 1 bit bitmap.<br><br>The way we achieve that on the Oric is by inserting <b>color change attributes</b> in the picture: <br><ul><li>if the attribute value is between 0 and 7, then the current <b>INK</b> value is changed<br></li><li>if the attribute value is between 16 and 23, then it's the new <b>PAPER</b> value (minus 16)<br></li></ul>Now of course that causes some problems, because you can only change <b>one color at a time</b>, and during that time you <b>can't display graphics</b>.<br><br>It is for this reason that that by default the oric does not make it possible to trace graphics in the 12 first pixels of the screen when colors are placed:

stretching effect.<br><br>Since the attributes never specify if you want to display the top or bottom part of the character, the ULA must decides itself. <br><br>The choices is based on the index of the text line being displayed: <br><ul><li>If the number is <b>EVEN</b> it will display the upper part<br></li><li>if it's <b>ODD</b> it will be the lower part<br></li></ul>If you want to scroll the

on an internal computation made by the ULA. <br><br>I suppose that tricking with 50hz and 60hz attributes will change the speed of a 5/6 or 6/5 ratio, but the only sure result is that your TV display will jump. <br><br>The only effect of blinking is to <b>force foreground</b> pixels (ink) to background when the blink is ON; the background color is never altered by a blinking effect. <br><br><br><a

<br><br>When the ULA reads this character, it switches to the HIRES drawing mode.<br><br>Then at some point toward the middle of the screen it encounters some values interpreted as a <b>50 Hertz text</b> attribute and reverts to TEXT mode.<br><br>The trick is to find a way to move freely between HIRES and TEXT while avoid the traps and sinkhole laying around in memory.<br><br>In order to mix and match video modes, all you can do is to use attributes at the location you want to force the ULA to start reading information from where you want it to, which means that you need to know the memory layout of both video modes to avoid conflicts.<br><br>The ULA will fetch the next byte to interpret based on the current pixel position on screen, and the current graphic mode:<br><ul><li>HIRES: <b>Current Byte = PEEK(#A000+(Y*40)+(X/6))</b> <br></li><li>TEXT:  <b>Current Byte = PEEK(#BB80+((Y/8)*40)+(X/6))</b></li></ul>Knowing this formula, you can easily predict

style="width:100%"></a><br><center>Text mode with Hires raster</center></div></center><br>You probably noticed that some characters were corrupted.<br><br>The reason is simply that when writing the INK and TEXT attributes in memory, around the line 100 <b>the address collided</b> with the character set area. <br><br>The address of theses CharSet tables are $B400 for the standard charset, and $B800 for the alternate charset, which happens to be <b>right in the middle</b> of the memory used by HIRES display.<br><br>Now, some simple calculations for knowing how many HIRES scan lines it is possible to display without interfering with the CharSet area: <br>$B400 (CharSet base adress) - $A000 (HIRES screen base adress) = 5120 bytes <br>5120 / 40 (size of a scan line) = 128 lines. <br><br>128 lines, is exactly where the screen started corrupted on the first mix screen example screenshot.<br><br>The important thing to realize is that because a character representation is 8 bytes long they actually fit nicely laid out in scanlines. Each line of the screen overlaps the definition of 40/8 = 5 characters.<br><br>What this means, is that if you know which bytes of the screen you are going to patch with attributes, then <b>you know which characters are going to be corrupted</b>.<br><br>In this example, we are writing to the offsets 1 and 2 of each scanline, which means we are altering two lines of every fifth character: A, F, K, P, U, Z, etc... out of 96 characters, 76 remain usable normally.<br><br><br>And finally a last example that shows that a <b>HIRES window</b> can be inserted in a standard TEXT mode.
